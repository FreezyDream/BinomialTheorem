# BinomialTheorem
Program is using Binomial Theorem to expand the polynomial (a + b)^n
# How to use the program
After the program has been compiled you are asked to give two double type numbers (a and b) and then to give the power (n) to which the binomial will be raised. It can be either positive or negative int number
# Your results
After giving all the needed numbers you will get as a result the formula for calculating your binomial and solved formula
